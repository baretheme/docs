    "build": "baretheme build",
    "start": "baretheme start"
  },
```

## Scripts
When you install the `@baretheme/next` package, Baretheme will install itself as an NPM binary.
You can run it from NPM via:
```
baretheme <command> <flags>
```
### Commands
These commands are available:
* `dev`: Starts the application in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc).
* `start`: Starts the application in production mode.
* `build`: Compiles the application for production deployment.
